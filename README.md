## Installation

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
$ pip install chainlit
$ chainlit hello
```

If this opens the `hello app` in your browser, you're all set!

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://docs.chainlit.io) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, simple examples)
- Examples
- Reference (full API docs)

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 🐍 Pure Python

Create a new file `demo.py` with the following code:

```python
   import chainlit as cl

@cl.on_message
def main(message: str, message_id: str):
    # Send an intermediate response from Tool 1.
    cl.Message(
        author="Tool 1",
        content="Response from Tool 1",
        parent_id=message_id,
    ).send()

    # Send the final answer.
    cl.Message(content="This is the final answer").send()

# Run the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    cl.run()
```
-> This version still accomplishes the same tasks but simplifies the code by removing the asynchronous function. It should also be more straightforward to understand. Additionally, I've added the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to ensure that the code is executed when the script is run directly.   


Now run it!

```
$ chainlit run demo.py -w
```
